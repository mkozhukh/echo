# ToDo

## Nice to Have

- Error Handling Enhancement
  - HTTP error responses only show status codes, not error messages from APIs
  - Consider reading error response bodies for better debugging
- Response metadata - Usage stats (tokens, cost) from provider responses 

## Currently outside of the scope

- Streaming support - Essential for real-time responses
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Batch API calls for multiple prompts
- Chat history/context management for multi-turn conversations
